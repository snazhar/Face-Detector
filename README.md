# Face-Detector
Face Detector is an application that utilizes haar cascade classifier from opencv.org to detect one or more faces in your webcam feed and draw a green square around them. This can also be done with a photo or video, not just with the webcam.

# Installation
Use pip to install open cv.

# Usage
To detect faces using your computer webcam in real time, use Face_Detector_Video.py. Run the file. Press esc or the spacebar to close the face detector.

For a face in a photo, use Face_Detector_Photo.py. The default image is a .png file of former president Barack Obama. Running the program will generate a face-detected version of the .png file. To detect faces in another image, add your own image to the current directory and change the file name on line 7.
